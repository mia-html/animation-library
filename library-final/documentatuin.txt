- You need to link saenimate.css to the desired HTML file.

- Saenimate animations work only if .saenimate class is applied to an element before
defining the animation and adding other classes.

-This library has ten animations. The animation classes are '.spin', '.fadeIn', '.fadeOut',
'.wobble', '.dance', '.shake', '.float', '.open', '.close' and '.accordion' (listed in the
order as displayed on the page).

-Each can be changed in many ways. Their duration can be altered (1-5 seconds using '.sec1',
'.sec2', '.sec3', '.sec4' and '.sec5' classes), as well as the number of times they can be
repeated (this can also be done using classes '.repeat1', '.repeat2', .'repeat3', '.repeat4',
'.repeat5' and '.infinite').

-Each animation has a hover and a focus state and a class for each ('.animationName-hover'
or '.animationName-focus')
